To update github Pages and portfolio

Step 1: Commit Changes
Before redeploying, ensure that youâ€™ve committed all the changes in your project. In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory and use the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
This ensures that your changes are recorded and ready to be pushed to GitHub.

Step 2: Push Changes to GitHub
Push the committed changes to your GitHub repository:

git push origin main  # or git push origin master if you're using the master branch
This step updates your GitHub repository with the latest changes.

Step 3: Run Build Script
If your project requires a build script, run it to generate the updated build:

npm run build
This command is essential for projects with specific build requirements, such as those created with Create React App.

Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Now, deploy the updated build to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages package:

npm run deploy
This command pushes the contents of the build directory to the gh-pages branch on your GitHub repository.
